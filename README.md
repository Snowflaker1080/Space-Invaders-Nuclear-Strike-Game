SPACE INVADERS: Nuclear Assault

Space Invaders: Nuclear Assault is a fast-paced, retro-inspired browser game built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Pilot a fighter jet to defend Earth from waves of alien invaders using bullets, missiles, and nukes. 
Featuring pixel-style sprites, explosive sound effects, and dynamic gameplay, this game brings arcade nostalgia to the modern browser.

No libraries, no frameworks—just pure JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Playable directly in the browser.

FEATURES

- Classic alien swarm attack patterns
- Three-tier weapon system: bullets, missiles, and nukes
- Dynamic sound effects and looping background music
- Keyboard and mobile touch controls
- Game over and win logic with restart functionality
- Score system with persistent high score tracking
- Starscape background and particle effects
- Switch between multiple player characters mid-game


⸻


HOW TO PLAY
 
Controls (Keyboard)
- A – Move Left
- D – Move Right
- SPACE – Fire bullets
- M – Fire missile
- V – Deploy nuke

Controls (Mobile)
- Tap ⬅️ / ➡️ buttons to move
- Tap 🔥 to fire bullets
- Tap 💣 to launch missiles
- Tap ☢️ to unleash a nuke

Your goal is to eliminate all alien fleets while avoiding incoming fire. Strategic use of nukes clears the entire screen, but they’re limited—use wisely!

ENGINEERING SUMMARY & DEVELOPMENT INSIGHTS

This project was built as part of an applied learning initiative focused on front-end software engineering and 2D browser-based game development. 
The goal was to design and implement a full-featured arcade-style shooter using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 <canvas>, and CSS — without external frameworks — to gain fluency in low-level browser APIs, real-time rendering, and interactive UI systems.



Systems Design & Technical Concepts

Custom Game Loop Architecture
- Engineered a frame-synchronized game loop using requestAnimationFrame, enabling smooth animations, time-based updates, and decoupled draw logic.
	
Canvas Rendering Pipeline
- Implemented low-level graphics rendering with HTML5 <canvas>, drawing and transforming sprites, particles, shockwaves, and UI overlays at runtime.
	
Entity-Component Object Management
- Modeled game objects (player, enemies, projectiles) as reusable class-based components, managing lifecycle, behaviour, and interaction via composition.
	
Stateful Game Logic & Control Flow
- Developed a deterministic game state system (e.g., start, play, win/loss, restart), ensuring consistent behaviour, loop resets, and UI synchronisation.
	
Collision Detection & Physics Handling
- Designed 2D collision systems using bounding boxes and radial proximity checks for precise hit detection between entities in motion.
	
Audio System Integration
- Integrated SFX and music playback with gesture-triggered policies to comply with browser autoplay restrictions and enhance player immersion.
	
Cross-Platform Input Handling
- Created both keyboard and mobile touch control schemes, including support for hold/long-press behaviour on virtual buttons, using event delegation.
	
Persistent Game State via Local Storage
- Implemented high score persistence with localStorage, reinforcing UX continuity across sessions without server dependencies.
	
Responsive UI & Visual Design
- Applied responsive CSS and dynamic scaling to adapt layout and controls for multiple screen sizes while maintaining playability and clarity.



Engineering Learnings & Outcomes
	
 - Applied object-oriented programming principles in a real-time system
	
 - Learned to manage runtime memory (e.g., cleaning up intervals, animation frames) to prevent game loop duplication and performance leaks
	
 - Gained working knowledge of browser graphics programming and rendering context optimisation
	
 - Practiced modularisation, code separation, and functional grouping to support scalability
	
 - Strengthened debugging techniques and runtime behaviour tracing using dev tools
	
 - Embraced software lifecycle practices such as version control, attribution compliance, and iterative development

This project demonstrates the practical integration of software engineering principles with interactive game systems, and serves as a milestone in the developer’s transition from foundational programming into system-level design, UI responsiveness, and real-time client-side architecture.

POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Gameplay Features

Power-Ups & Upgrades
- Introduce collectible power-ups (e.g., faster fire rate, shield, double damage) or a weapon upgrade system tied to score or kill streaks.

Multiple Enemy Types & Behaviours
- Add varied alien classes (e.g., fast scouts, heavy tanks, teleporters) with unique movement patterns and attack styles.

Level Progression & Boss Fights
- Implement structured levels or waves with increasing difficulty, culminating in boss battles with multi-phase mechanics.

Lives, Health System & Checkpoints
- Expand the health/lives mechanic with partial damage, shield bars, or lives-based continues.

Multiplayer (Local or Online)
- Add local two-player co-op (split-screen or shared) or experiment with real-time multiplayer using WebSockets.

⸻

AI & Procedural Systems

Alien Movement AI
- Use basic pathfinding or steering behaviours instead of rigid grid formations.

Procedural Wave Generation
- Generate alien waves dynamically based on player performance or difficulty curve.

Difficulty Scaling
- Adapt game speed, spawn rates, and enemy aggression over time or by score.

⸻

UI/UX & Audio Enhancements

Pause Menu & Settings Panel
- Include a pause button with volume sliders, control remapping, and game instructions.

In-Game Soundtrack Manager
- Cycle through multiple tracks or let players toggle music types.

Animated Title Screen & Credits
- Add polish to the home screen with animated logos, transitions, and a proper credits page.

⸻

Technical Improvements

Modular Code Refactoring
- Break the codebase into more reusable modules (e.g., GameEngine.js, UIManager.js, SoundManager.js) for scalability.

Use a Game Framework (Optional)
- Port to a lightweight game framework like Phaser.js for more advanced physics, scene management, and easier mobile publishing.

Save Game State
- Store player progress, settings, or last played level in localStorage or IndexedDB.

⸻

Stretch Goals

Touch Gestures & Accelerometer Support

- Add swipe-based movement or device tilt control for a native mobile feel.

High Score Leaderboard (Online)

- Use Firebase or Supabase to store and retrieve high scores globally.

PWA (Progressive Web App)

- Convert your game into a PWA to support offline play and mobile home screen launching.
